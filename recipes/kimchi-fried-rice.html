    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kimchi fried rice is a popular South Korean dish made with (you guessed it!) kimchi and rice. The budget-friendly, easy-to-make meal is a great way to use leftover rice. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup ground beef</li>
        <li>1 green onion, sliced, white and green parts separated</li>
        <li>1 cup well-fermented kimchi, drained and chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste), or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>3 cups cooked short-grain rice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat canola oil in large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add ground beef and white parts of green onion; reduce heat to medium. Cook and stir beef and green onion until meat is browned and onion is fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir kimchi and gochujang into meat mixture and cook until warmed through and fragrant, 2 to 4 minutes. Add rice; cook and stir until rice is heated through and coated with gochujang, 3 to 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Drizzle sesame oil over rice mixture and stir to coat. Garnish with green parts of green onion.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Crack egg into the pan and cook until white is completely set and yolk is thick, 3 to 4 minutes. Place egg over fried rice.</li>
    </ol>
